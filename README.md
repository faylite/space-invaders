# Space Invaders Clone
This is an old Space Invaders clone I had laying around, the purpose of the game was to learn about libgdx and is no longer under active development, feel free to create pull requests though.

# Building
This game uses libgdx and gradle see the libgdx wiki for more info

To run the desktop project simply use the included gradlew

Linux: 
./gradlew desktop:run

Windows: 
gradlew.bat desktop:run
